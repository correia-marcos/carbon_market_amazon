- Project is under investigation by legal authorities
- In the Public Comment period, The NBS Brazil Alliance said that:
	. Analyzing the last Jari Pará REDD+ project Monitoring Report, it is possible to observe that the project had some challenges in complying with all the proposed social and biodiversity actions due to some obstacles, such as financial issues of the Jari institute (co-proponent)
	. There is very little information on the quantification of emissions (only references to the already validated PD calculations), so it is not possible to assess this aspect of the project in detail.
	. There is a critical point in the MR, which despite being widely addressed in the MR (item 2.4.1), it is not possible to fully confirm due to lack of evidence (only the audit available). This is a possible land ownership dispute (Gleba Jari I) between the Jari Institute and the state of Pará

- In the Public Comment period, The NBS Brazil Alliance said that:
	. It should be interesting to provide an explanation on why the baseline GHG emission, presented on table 6 of this MR, is different from the baseline GHG emission presented in the Table on page 175 of the PD. Considering that the present monitoring is under the same baseline as presented in the PD (under 6 years, so no revalidation needed) it should have equal values
	. When assessing the leakage in the current monitoring, it was important to check it on the PD. It should be interesting to justify why the leakage value in the Project Description is considered zero, since considering VM0015 leakage cannot be considered zero in the baseline scenario
	. In 2.3.14 it is said that most jobs created by the project are related to planting trees. However, reforestation is not included as a Project Activity. More detail should be given to better explain the correlation between the Project Activities and its employability.
	. Regarding the monitored parameters, the ones presented in the PD where monitored in the MR02 as expected. However, there is an incoherence with the values presented under the item 'Number of Verified Carbon Units (VCUs) to be made available for trade at time t' ( 997,614; 1,163,611; 1,142,927) and the final numbers of tradables VCUs presented at at Table 6 (150,367; 269,688;313,087)

- The project is under investigation by a public civil action against three companies and private entity that are. The project is using public areas (five state agro -extractive settlements) without correct permissions - green grilage. Projects proponents also have argued that they have payed for the land tenure of "ribeirinhos", but they actually only made the Cadastro Ambiental Rural (CAR) of them, which is a self -declaratory electronic record that is mandatory for all rural properties. According to public defender Andreia Barreto, Ribeirinho Redd+ was based on 191 illegal rural environmental records, of which 190 have already been canceled and one is suspended.
